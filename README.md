This sample demonstrate android webview choose file to upload.
I just implement the client code ,the server code of receiver the file is not implemented. 

First of all, you should build the server code by your eclipse(server code was wrote by java). [server code download](https://github.com/chiclaim/android_mvvm_server)

Then update the ip of url(get ip mac command `ifconfig` windows command `ipconfig`).

Eventually, Run the android code on your device or emulator.
